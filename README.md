- Tesla Charge Reporting  - 
This application is designed to help measure how much electricty I use to charge my car for purposes of splitting costs
with the people I live with.  

This is just a basic script that processes a report that i have to manually generate using Tezlab's mobile app

In the future, I would like to be able to have this basically just run once a month and have it gather all the data it needs by itself.  Also, I would like to make things more flexible so that it can be adapted for more people to use

Special Thanks to Tezlab
